## About Me

I am a first generation college student working hard to turn my lifelong passion for technology into products that I can be proud of. Starting in highschool when I took AP Computer Science, I found my love for creating. Currently, I am studying at Allegheny College, pursuing a major in computer science with a minor in economics in order to make it happen. Right now, I am fascinated by blockchain technology, and creating in the world of cryptocurrency. At the same time, I am developing my professional skills in the areas of databases, web development, and Python and C programming. I wanted to create this site to show what I have achieved thus far, and increase my web developing skills
