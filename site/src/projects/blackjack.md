summary: A command line blackjack game written in Python! I was messing around with object orientation in Python and wanted to create a fun little game out of and this was the result. I am still working on cleaning up the code and output, but it is fully functional. This blackjack game pits you against an AI dealer, and enables you to bet virtual chips.
