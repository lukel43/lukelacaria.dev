### [GitHub](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade)
### Task

Work as a team to overhaul [GatorGradle](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgradle), a Java based system that executes a grading tool that is able to grade assignments based on user defined checks and report those results to both professors and students. The goal was to convert the system to a Python based implementation, in order to stay consistent with Allegheny College's newly Python based cirriculum. The tool must be able to run [GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader).

### Solution

Split into teams, to accomplish the tasks listed above using agile development methodology. I joined the output team, which meant my team and I were responsible for handling and formatting data and making sure it was output properly to the user. We were able to accomplish all requirements in under 6 weeks. Now, this system is being used by the entirety of the Allegheny College computer science department in order to grade assignments transparently and communicate those results to students.
