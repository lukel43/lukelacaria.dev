If you'd like to have a chat about anything technical, professional, or anything in between feel free to schedule an appointment. Below, you can schedule a Google Meet in 30 minute time slots. If you want to have a longer chat or use another platform, reach out to me via the email link at the bottom of the page and we can figure out an arrangement that works!
