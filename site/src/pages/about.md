I am a first generation college student working hard to turn my lifelong passion for technology into products that I can be proud of. Starting in highschool when I took AP Computer Science, I found my love for creating. Currently, I am studying at Allegheny College, pursuing a major in computer science with a minor in economics in order to make it happen. Right now, I am fascinated by blockchain technology, and creating in the world of cryptocurrency. At the same time, I am developing my professional skills in the areas of databases, web development, and Python and C programming.

## Research Interests

My current research focuses on finding a way to make cryptocurrency a seamless way to transact. I am in the process of developing *Monero Merchant*, an application that aims to allow merchants to easily transact using Monero inside of physical stores. I am accomplishing this by using [monero-javascript](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-javascript) to create an interface that allows merchants to create QR codes for every product containing subaddresses to allow payment requests for each product. The app will then also use the data from the wallet to display sales data to the merchant within the app. Think [Square Point of Sale terminal](https://squareup.com/us/en/point-of-sale), but for Monero. 

## Stage in Career

I am currently beginning my career as both a software engineer and blockchain developer. To develop my skills, I have been learning Solidity and Rust in my free time, while studying computer science and economics at Allegheny College. This unique intersection of skills will afford me valuable insights into both the cryptocurrency and software engineering industries. I am currently pursuing an internship that will allow me to explore the cryptocurrency/blockchain industry, or further develop my skills in software engineering. I have made some open source contribution to software such as [GatorGrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade), and am currently working on some exciting blockchain, web development, and database projects! I am excited to learn more about how I can create value using my skills.
