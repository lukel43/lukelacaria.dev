I am a software engineer and blockchain developer who considers both the economic and social ramifications of my projects. I am a first-generation college student currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Economics from Allegheny College. As someone who has grown up through both a technology boom and economic crises, technological solutions to economic problems have always been of special interest to me. I am currently pursuing positions that could provide me exposure to the blockchain industry, but I would be open to any software engineering opportunities. I hope to use technology to provide easy and equal access to financial and technological services for everyone in the world.

## Research Interests

My research explores ways to allow more users easy access to technological and economic services. I believe that good software must be simple for both users and developers, to gain adoption. To this end, I have begun researching various ways to accomplish this, such as a Monero Merchant Payment System and an NBA Tracking Data SQL Database with a Python Interface. In light of the recent Terra-Luna crash, I am also very interested in the implication of stablecoins on the cryptocurrency market. My goal is to increase the adoption of cryptocurrency as a payment method, thus increasing access to economic services. Likewise, I hope to provide more easily accessible information to the general public using technology.

## Who I am

As someone passionate about using technology to create meaningful change, I am very involved both at my college and in my community, as a participant in clubs and a volunteer. I am currently pursuing a major in Computer Science with a minor in Economics to develop my skills to perfectly complement my interests. I am someone who enjoys diverse experiences and strives to do something new as often as possible. In my free time, I play or watch basketball, and research cryptocurrency.

## Stage in Career

I am currently beginning my career as both a software engineer and blockchain developer. To develop my skills, I have been learning Solidity and Rust in my free time, while studying Computer Science and Economics at Allegheny College. This unique intersection of skills will afford me valuable insights into both the cryptocurrency and software engineering industries. I am currently pursuing an internship that will allow me to explore the cryptocurrency/blockchain industry, but I am open to any internships in the software engineering space. I have made some open source contributions that are viewable on my GitHub, and am currently working on some exciting blockchain, web development, and database projects! I am excited to learn more about how I can benefit others using my skills.
